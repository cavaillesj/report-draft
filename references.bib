	abstract = {The amount and dynamics of forest dead wood (both standing and downed) has been quantiﬁed by a variety of approaches throughout the forest science and ecology literature. Differences in the sampling and quantiﬁcation of dead wood can lead to differences in our understanding of forests and their role in the sequestration and emissions of {CO}2, as well as in developing appropriate strategies for achieving dead wood-related objectives, including biodiversity protection, and procurement of forest bioenergy feedstocks. A thorough understanding of the various methods available for quantifying dead wood stores and decomposition is critical for comparing studies and drawing valid conclusions. General assessments of forest dead wood are conducted by numerous countries as a part of their national forest inventories, while detailed experiments that employ ﬁeld-based and modeling methods to understand woody debris patterns and processes have greatly advanced our understanding of dead wood dynamics. We review methods for quantifying dead wood in forest ecosystems, with an emphasis on biomass and carbon attributes. These methods encompass various sampling protocols for inventorying standing dead trees and downed woody debris, and an assortment of approaches for forecasting wood decomposition through time. Recent research has provided insight on dead wood attributes related to biomass and carbon content, through the use of structural reduction factors and robust modeling approaches, both of which have improved our understanding of dead wood dynamics. Our review, while emphasizing temperate forests, identiﬁes key research needs and knowledge which at present impede our ability to accurately characterize dead wood populations. In sum, we synthesize the current literature on the measurement and dynamics of forest dead wood carbon stores and decomposition as a baseline for researchers and natural resource managers concerned about forest dead wood patterns and processes.},

	abstract = {The combination of certain features of ﬁre disturbance, notably ﬁre frequency, size and severity, may be used to characterize the disturbance regime in any region of the boreal forest. As some consequences of ﬁre resemble the effects of industrial forest harvesting, conventional forest management is often considered as a disturbance that has effects similar to those of natural disturbances. Although the analogy between forest management and ﬁre disturbance in boreal ecosystems has some merit, it is important to recognise that it also has its limitations. Short ﬁre cycles generally described for boreal ecosystems do not appear to be universal; rather, important spatial and temporal variations have been observed in Canada. These variations in the ﬁre cycle have an important inﬂuence on forest composition and structure at the landscape and regional levels. Size and severity of ﬁres also show a large range of variability. In regions where the natural matrix of the boreal forest remains relatively intact, maintenance of this natural variability should be targeted by forest managers concerned with biodiversity conservation. Current forest management tends to reduce this variability: for example, fully regulated, even-aged management will tend to truncate the natural forest age distribution and eliminate over-mature and old-growth forests from the landscape. We suggest that the development of strategic-level forest management planning approaches and silvicultural techniques designed to maintain a spectrum of forest compositions and structures at different scales in the landscape is one avenue to maintain this variability. Although we use the boreal forest of Quebec for our examples, it is possible to apply the approach to those portions of the boreal forest where the ﬁre regime favours the development of even-aged stands in burns.},

	abstract = {Successful management of forest ﬁre risk in the Northeastern China boreal forest ecosystem often involves trade-offs between ﬁre dynamics, ﬁre hazard reduction, and ﬁscal input. We used the {LANDIS} model to study the effects of alternative fuel reduction strategies on ﬁre dynamics and analyzed cost effectiveness for each fuel reduction strategy based on cost–beneﬁt theory. Five levels of fuel treatment area (2, 4, 6, 8, and 10\% for each decade) and two fuel treatment types (prescribed burning [{PB}] and mechanical treatments in combination with prescribed ﬁre [{PR}]) under current ﬁre suppression simulated by {LANDIS} were compared in a 5 Â 2 factorial design over a 300-year period. The results showed that {PR} scenarios are more effective at reducing the occurrence and burn area of catastrophic ﬁres than {PB} scenarios. In addition, area burned by high intensity ﬁre can be tremendously reduced by increasing low intensity ﬁres with a higher level of treatment area under the various {PR} scenarios. The cost effectiveness of alternative fuel reduction strategies is strongly dependent on treatment area. In general, {PB} scenarios will be more cost effective in larger treatment areas and {PR} scenarios in smaller. We recommend mechanical treatments in combination with prescribed ﬁre, with 4\% of landscape treated in each decade ({PR}04) to be the optimal fuel reduction strategy in the study area based on risk control and cost efﬁciency analysis. However, the most challenging work in China is to make local forest policy makers and land managers accept the ecological function of ﬁre on forest ecosystems.},

Newly available geospatial data sets characterizing vegetation, fuels, topography, and burn severity offer new opportunities for studying fuel treatment effectiveness at regional to national scales. In this study, we used ordinary least-squares ({OLS}) regression and sequential autoregression ({SAR}) to analyze fuel treatment effects on burn severity for three recent wildﬁres: the Camp 32 ﬁre in western Montana, the School ﬁre in southeastern Washington, and the Warm ﬁre in northern Arizona. Burn severity was measured using differenced normalized burn ratio ({dNBR}) maps developed by the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity project. Geospatial data sets from the {LANDFIRE} project were used to control for preﬁre variability in canopy cover, fuels, and topography. Across all three ﬁres, treatments that incorporated prescribed burning were more effective than thinning alone. Treatment effect sizes were lower, and standard errors were higher in the {SAR} models than in the {OLS} models. Spatial error terms in the {SAR} models indirectly controlled for confounding variables not captured in the {LANDFIRE} data, including spatiotemporal variability in ﬁre weather and landscape-level effects of reduced ﬁre severity outside the treated areas. This research demonstrates the feasibility of carrying out assessments of fuel treatment effectiveness using geospatial data sets and highlights the potential for using spatial autoregression to control for unmeasured confounding factors.},

	abstract = {Resilience is a component of ecological stability; it is assessed as the rate at which perturbations to a stable ecological system decay. The most frequently used estimate of resilience is based on the eigenvalues of the system at its equilibrium. In most cases, this estimate describes the rate of recovery only asymptotically, as time goes to inﬁnity. However, in the short term, perturbations can grow signiﬁcantly before they decay, and eigenvalues provide no information about this transient behavior. We present several new measures of transient response that complement resilience as a description of the response to perturbation. These indices measure the extent and duration of transient growth in models with asymptotically stable equilibria. They are the reactivity (the maximum possible growth rate immediately following the perturbation), the maximum ampliﬁcation (the largest proportional deviation that can be produced by any perturbation), and the time at which this ampliﬁcation occurs. We demonstrate the calculation of these indices using previously published linear compartment models (two models for phosphorus cycling through a lake ecosystem and one for the ﬂow of elements through a tropical rain forest) and a standard nonlinear predator–prey model. Each of these models exhibits transient growth of perturbations, despite asymptotic stability. Measures of relative stability that ignore transient growth will often give a misleading picture of the response to a perturbation. Key words: compartment models; eigenvalues; pulse perturbations; reactivity; relative stability; resilience; return time; transient vs. asymptotic dynamics.},

	abstract = {Human actions challenge nature in many ways. Ecological responses are ineluctably complex, demanding measures that describe them succinctly. Collectively, these measures encapsulate the overall ‘stability’ of the system. Many international bodies, including the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, broadly aspire to maintain or enhance ecological stability. Such bodies frequently use terms pertaining to stability that lack clear deﬁnition. Consequently, we cannot measure them and so they disconnect from a large body of theoretical and empirical understanding. We assess the scientiﬁc and policy literature and show that this disconnect is one consequence of an inconsistent and one-dimensional approach that ecologists have taken to both disturbances and stability. This has led to confused communication of the nature of stability and the level of our insight into it. Disturbances and stability are multidimensional. Our understanding of them is not. We have a remarkably poor understanding of the impacts on stability of the characteristics that deﬁne many, perhaps all, of the most important elements of global change. We provide recommendations for theoreticians, empiricists and policymakers on how to better integrate the multidimensional nature of ecological stability into their research, policies and actions.},

	abstract = {Resilience as a descriptive concept gives insight into the dynamic properties of an ecological-economic system. Sustainability as a normative concept captures basic ideas of intergenerational justice when human well-being depends on natural capital and services. Thus, resilience and sustainability are independent concepts. In this paper, we discuss the relationship between resilience and sustainability of ecologicaleconomic systems. We use a simple dynamic model where two natural capital stocks provide ecosystem services that are complements for human well-being, to illustrate different possible cases of the relationship between resilience and sustainability, and to identify the conditions under which each of those will hold: a) resilience of the system is necessary, but not sufﬁcient, for sustainability; b) resilience of the system is sufﬁcient, but not necessary, for sustainability; c) resilience of the system is neither necessary nor sufﬁcient for sustainability; and d) resilience is both necessary and sufﬁcient for sustainability. We conclude that more criteria than just resilience have to be taken into account when designing policies for the sustainable development of ecological-economic systems, and, vice versa, the property of resilience should not be confused with the positive normative connotations of sustainability.},

Population size (N) and trend were clearly the best correlates of extinction risk in our data set. Stepwise multiple regression with additive and interaction terms identiﬁed N , N Â trend, plus taxonomic level, number of sub-populations Â N Â trend, number of oﬀspring (O) and N Â O as predictors, and explained 70\% of the variation. Trend was important in large, but not in small populations.

	abstract = {Empirical knowledge of ecosystem stability and diversity-stability relationships is mostly based on the analysis of temporal variability of population and ecosystem properties. Variability, however, often depends on external factors that act as disturbances, making it difficult to compare its value across systems and relate it to other stability concepts. Here we show how variability, when viewed as a response to stochastic perturbations, can reveal inherent stability properties of ecological communities, with clear connections with other stability notions. This requires abandoning one-dimensional representations, in which a single variability measurement is taken as a proxy for how stable a system is, and instead consider the whole set of  variability values associated to a given community, reflecting the whole set of perturbations that can generate variability. Against the vertiginous dimensionality of the perturbation set, we show that a generic variability-abundance pattern emerges  from community assembly, which relates variability to the abundance of perturbed species. As a consequence, the response to stochastic immigration is governed by rare species while common species drive the response to environmental perturbations. In particular, the contrasting contributions of different species abundance classes can lead to opposite diversity-stability patterns, which can be understood from basic statistics of the abundance distribution. Our work shows that a multidimensional perspective on variability allows one to better appreciate the dynamical richness of ecological systems and the underlying meaning of their stability patterns.},

Current ﬁre management privileges ﬁre suppression and tends to ignore land management issues, which may further accelerate the transition to a more ﬁre-prone future and magnify the problem. Fire-smart management aims to control the ﬁre regime by intervening on vegetation (fuel) to foster more ﬁre-resistant (less ﬂammable) and/or ﬁre-resilient environments. Scientiﬁc knowledge supporting the creation and maintenance of ﬁre-smart wildlands is critically reviewed, considering the landscape and the forest stand scales. Fuel management strategies (isolation, structural modiﬁcation, and type conversion) are discussed in regards to their current and future potential to buffer the effects of global change on the extent and severity of ﬁres. Uncertainty in the outcomes of ﬁre-smart management arises mainly from insufﬁcient understanding of the relative weights of fuel and weather-drought on the ﬁre regime. Likewise, linkage between global change processes and the ﬁre regime is not straightforward. Shrublands and, in general, open and dry vegetation types will prevail even more in future landscapes. Decrease in biomass will limit ﬁre incidence over parts of the Mediterranean. However, the ﬁre regime will be largely driven by weather, advising concentration of fuel management efforts in wildland–urban interfaces and in forests and their vicinity; decrease of landscape ﬁre severity rather than area burned as the objective; prescribed burning as the treatment of choice, except in the wildland-urban interface; and focus on forest types that are ﬁre-resilient irrespective of ﬂammability.},

The idea that decades of fire suppression have promoted unnatural fuel accumulation and subsequent unprecedentedly large, severe wildfires across western forests has been developed primarily from studies of dry ponderosa pine forests. However, this model is being applied uncritically across Rocky Mountain forests (e.g., in the Healthy Forests Restoration Act). We synthesize current research and summarize lessons learned from recent large wildfires (the Yellowstone, Rodeo-Chediski, and Hayman fires), which represent case studies of the potential effectiveness of fuel reduction across a range of major forest types. A “one size fits all” approach to reducing wildfire hazards in the Rocky Mountain region is unlikely to be effective and may produce collateral damage in some places.},

	abstract = {Climatic variability is a dominant factor affecting large wildfires in the western United States, an observation supported by palaeoecological data on charcoal in lake sediments and reconstructions from fire-scarred trees. Although current fire management focuses on fuel reductions to bring fuel loadings back to their historical ranges, at the regional scale extreme fire weather is still the dominant influence on area burned and fire severity. Current forecasting tools are limited to short-term predictions of fire weather, but increased understanding of large-scale oceanic and atmospheric patterns in the Pacific Ocean (e.g., El Nin˜o Southern Oscillation, Pacific Decadal Oscillation) may improve our ability to predict climatic variability at seasonal to annual leads. Associations between these quasi-periodic patterns and fire occurrence, though evident in some regions, have been difficult to establish in others. Increased temperature in the future will likely extend fire seasons throughout the western United States, with more fires occurring earlier and later than is currently typical, and will increase the total area burned in some regions. If climatic change increases the amplitude and duration of extreme fire weather, we can expect significant changes in the distribution and abundance of dominant plant species in some ecosystems, which would thus affect habitat of some sensitive plant and animal species. Some species that are sensitive to fire may decline, whereas the distribution and abundance of species favored by fire may be enhanced. The effects of climatic change will partially depend on the extent to which resource management modifies vegetation structure and fuels.},

Some have charged thatmanagingforests in waysthatare responsive to diverse and changing forest values is the main challenge faced by public forest managers. To tackle this challenge, we need to address the following questions: (1) Whatis the nature offorest values? Thatis, can all forest values be reduced to a single dimension, as assumed in utilitarian-based traditional forestry and economics, or are these values multidimensional and incommensurate? (2) What specific values are involved? (3) What is the structure offorest values? Thatis, howare they related to each other in value systems? (4) How and why have forest values changed over time? and (5) What do changing forest values imply for ecosystem management approaches? This article discusses key issues related to these questions.},

	abstract = {This article aims to assess the sustainability of forestry in Spain at provincial scale from two points of view: ﬁrst, a multidimensional perspective considering the three classical dimensions of sustainability – environmental, economic and social – and, second, an integrative approach estimating a global index for forest sustainability. While the construction of such a global index is methodologically difﬁcult and arguable, it could be very useful to land planners when drawing up and reviewing forestry and environmental policies. The global index of forest sustainability suggested in this study is calculated for the ﬁfty Spanish provinces, based on a selection of twenty indicators. The majority of them (thirteen) relate to environmental dimension, four to economic dimension and three to social dimension. Numerous statistics and cartographic sources are used. A methodology is proposed based on grouping selected indicators according to three intermediate composite indicators and, subsequently, a global super-index. Cluster analysis establishes four different types of provinces according to their forest sustainability. According to the global sustainability index, part of the forests of the Mediterranean coast, those located near large inland cities and in southern Galicia appear to be less sustainable as a consequence of land artiﬁcialisation processes and forest ﬁres. Conversely, Atlantic and Pyrenees forests, and those of the northern Plateau are more sustainable due to their relative success in keeping forest traditional uses and containing emerging threats.},

Although primarily deﬁned at the national scale, these C \& I also have implications at scales ranging from forest stands to the forest management unit. In this paper, we review existing forest growth and ecosystem models from the point of view of applicability to prediction of indicators of sustainable management, focusing on stand scale models and management. To do this, we ﬁrst present a conceptual framework for understanding the role of models in assessing forest management at the stand level in the context of sustainability criteria and indicators. We classify the criteria into those predictable using models operating at the stand scale, and those derivable either through scaling up or as solutions of a multi-objective management optimisation problem.},
